# Guide Me



Are you looking for the best guide for you next holiday? With the webapp Guide Me, you can create your own guide from scratch by selecting only the points of interest you really want. Then follow the path generated by the app(MapBox API) to visit all monuments you selected. You will get a small for description for each.


Build on Ruby On Rails, this mobile first app was created during a two weeks long project.
